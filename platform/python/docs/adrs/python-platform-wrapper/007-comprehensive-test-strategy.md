# ADR-007: Comprehensive Test Strategy with Descriptive Naming

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Python Platform Wrapper requires thorough testing to ensure reliability and maintainability. Several testing approaches were considered:

1. **Basic Unit Tests**: Simple test methods with minimal coverage
2. **BDD-Style Testing**: Behavior-driven development with Given/When/Then
3. **Descriptive Test Naming**: Self-documenting test names with clear scenarios
4. **Property-Based Testing**: Generated test cases with hypothesis

The choice affects test maintainability, documentation value, and debugging experience.

## Decision
We will implement **comprehensive testing with descriptive naming** following the pattern:
`test_<what>__when_<scenario>__should_<result>`

## Rationale

### Descriptive Test Naming Benefits:
1. **Self-Documentation**: Test names serve as living documentation
2. **Clear Intent**: Immediately understand what's being tested
3. **Better Failure Messages**: Failed tests clearly indicate what broke
4. **Specification by Example**: Tests define expected behavior
5. **Regression Prevention**: Clear scenarios prevent future breakage

### Naming Pattern Examples:
```python
def test_get__with_existing_string_value__should_return_value(self):
def test_get__with_missing_key_required__should_raise_config_error(self):
def test_publish__should_create_event_envelope(self):
def test_with_tx__should_handle_exceptions_correctly(self):
```

### Coverage Goals:
- **89% code coverage** achieved across all modules
- **120 comprehensive tests** covering all functionality
- **Edge case testing** for error conditions and boundary cases
- **Integration testing** for end-to-end scenarios

## Technical Implementation

### Test Organization:
```
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py              # Shared fixtures and configuration
├── test_interfaces.py       # Interface validation tests
├── test_logger.py           # ConsoleLogger implementation tests
├── test_config.py           # EnvironmentConfig implementation tests
├── test_stubs.py            # All stub service tests
└── test_factory.py          # Factory function tests
```

### Test Categories:

#### 1. Interface Validation Tests:
- Verify all interfaces are proper Abstract Base Classes
- Check abstract method definitions
- Validate method signatures and type hints

#### 2. Implementation Tests:
- **Logger Tests**: Structured JSON output, child loggers, debug filtering
- **Config Tests**: Type conversion, caching, error handling
- **Stub Tests**: All service interfaces, dependency injection, async behavior

#### 3. Integration Tests:
- Factory function behavior
- Service dependency injection
- End-to-end service interaction

### Async Testing:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_query__should_return_empty_list(self, stub_db):
    """Database query should return empty list in stub implementation"""
    result = await stub_db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
    assert result == []
```

## Test Infrastructure

### Pytest Configuration:
- **asyncio support** with pytest-asyncio plugin
- **Coverage reporting** with pytest-cov
- **Automatic markers** for async and integration tests
- **Custom fixtures** for common test scenarios

### Fixtures and Helpers:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def clean_environment():
    """Provides clean environment for configuration tests"""
    with patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True):
        yield

@pytest.fixture 
def sample_event_envelope():
    """Provides sample EventEnvelope for testing"""
    return EventEnvelope(...)
```

### Helper Functions:
```python
def assert_log_contains(captured_logs: str, expected_message: str, expected_level: str = None):
    """Helper to verify structured log output"""

def assert_json_log_structure(log_line: str, expected_fields: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Helper to validate JSON log structure"""
```

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Living Documentation**: Tests document expected behavior
- **Easy Debugging**: Clear test names indicate failure causes
- **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive coverage prevents bugs
- **Confidence**: High coverage enables safe refactoring
- **Onboarding**: New developers understand system through tests

### Negative:
- **Longer Test Names**: More verbose than simple test names
- **More Test Code**: Comprehensive coverage requires more tests
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Tests need updating with behavior changes

### Mitigation:
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow established patterns for predictability
- **Good Fixtures**: Reusable test infrastructure reduces duplication
- **Regular Review**: Keep tests current with functionality changes

## Test Coverage Analysis

### By Module:
- **factory.py**: 100% coverage (28/28 statements)
- **logger.py**: 100% coverage (29/29 statements)
- **stubs.py**: 98% coverage (200/205 statements)
- **config.py**: 83% coverage (86/104 statements)
- **interfaces.py**: 73% coverage (80/109 statements) - Abstract methods not covered
- **__init__.py**: 100% coverage (9/9 statements)

### Overall: 89% coverage (432/484 statements)

## Testing Patterns

### Error Condition Testing:
```python
def test_get__with_missing_key_required__should_raise_config_error(self):
    with patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True):
        config = EnvironmentConfig()
        
        with pytest.raises(ConfigError) as exc_info:
            config.get("MISSING_KEY", required=True)
        
        assert "Required configuration key 'MISSING_KEY' is missing" in str(exc_info.value)
```

### Mock and Dependency Testing:
```python
def test_get__should_log_operations(self, stub_secrets):
    mock_logger = MagicMock()
    stub_secrets.logger = mock_logger
    
    await stub_secrets.get("TEST_SECRET")
    
    mock_logger.debug.assert_called()
```

### Integration Testing:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_factory_services__should_work_together__end_to_end(self):
    services = create_platform_services()
    
    # Test cross-service integration
    await services.pubsub.publish("test.event", {"data": "test"})
    await services.cache.set("key", "value")
    result = await services.db.query("SELECT 1")
    
    assert len(services.pubsub.get_event_history()) == 1
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Simple Unit Tests
- **Pros**: Quick to write, minimal setup
- **Cons**: Poor documentation value, unclear failure messages
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for complex platform services

### BDD-Style Tests (Given/When/Then)
- **Pros**: Very readable, business-focused
- **Cons**: Verbose, overhead of BDD framework
- **Rejected**: Over-engineering for technical platform services

### Property-Based Testing
- **Pros**: Comprehensive edge case coverage, bug finding
- **Cons**: Complex setup, harder to understand failures
- **Rejected**: Too complex for current needs, can be added later

### Minimal Testing
- **Pros**: Fast development, less maintenance
- **Cons**: Poor quality assurance, regression prone
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for production platform services

## Continuous Integration

### Test Execution:
- All tests run on every commit
- Coverage reporting integrated
- Both unit and integration test execution
- Async test support in CI environment

### Quality Gates:
- Minimum 85% code coverage required
- All tests must pass for merge
- No regressions in test suite
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths

## Review Date
This decision should be reviewed if:
- Test maintenance becomes excessive burden
- Coverage requirements prove inadequate
- Alternative testing approaches show significant benefits
- Team feedback indicates testing strategy issues
