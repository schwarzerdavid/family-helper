# ADR-004: Platform Wrapper Interface Enhancement

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Deciders:** David Schwarzer, Claude  

## Context

The Phase 0 requirements specified basic platform wrapper interfaces (Logger, Config, Secrets, Db, PubSub) for abstracting cloud provider services. During implementation, we needed to decide whether to implement only the minimum required interfaces or extend them with additional commonly needed platform services.

The original specification included:
- Basic Logger (info, error, with)
- Simple Config (get with optional/required)
- Minimal Secrets (get)
- Basic Db (query, withTx)
- Simple PubSub (publish, subscribe)

However, real-world applications typically need additional platform services like object storage, caching, feature flags, and distributed tracing.

## Decision

We decided to **enhance the platform wrapper interfaces** beyond the minimum requirements by adding:

1. **ObjectStorage Interface** - For file upload/download and presigned URLs
2. **Cache Interface** - For Redis-like key-value operations with TTL
3. **FeatureFlags Interface** - For runtime configuration and A/B testing
4. **Tracer Interface** - For distributed tracing and observability

Additionally, we enhanced existing interfaces:
- Logger: Added `warn` and `debug` levels, environment-based filtering
- Config: Added type conversion, caching, validation, prefix-based retrieval
- EventEnvelope: Added tracing fields and idempotency support

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Future-proofing**: Platform ready for common enterprise requirements
- **Developer Experience**: Rich feature set available immediately
- **Consistency**: All platform services follow same interface patterns
- **Testability**: Comprehensive stub implementations for all services
- **Production Ready**: Advanced features like caching, tracing, error handling

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More interfaces to maintain and implement
- **Over-engineering Risk**: May include features not immediately needed
- **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand more interfaces
- **Testing Overhead**: More comprehensive test suite required

### Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Could delay Phase 0 completion (mitigated by keeping stubs simple)
- **Interface Churn**: May need to modify interfaces as real implementations are added
- **Dependency Management**: More complex service container management

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Minimal Implementation (Original Spec Only)
- **Pros**: Simple, meets exact requirements, faster initial implementation
- **Cons**: Would require adding interfaces later, potential breaking changes, less useful for development

### Alternative 2: Plugin Architecture
- **Pros**: Extensible, optional features, smaller core
- **Cons**: More complex architecture, harder to discover features, fragmented experience

### Alternative 3: Multiple Platform Packages
- **Pros**: Separate concerns, optional dependencies
- **Cons**: Package management complexity, version coordination issues

## Implementation Notes

- All new interfaces include comprehensive stub implementations
- Factory pattern provides easy service container creation
- Type safety maintained throughout with TypeScript generics
- Error handling consistent across all interfaces
- Documentation and tests demonstrate usage patterns

## Review Criteria

This decision should be revisited if:
- Real implementation costs become prohibitive
- Interface churn becomes problematic
- Simpler alternative patterns prove more effective
- Performance or maintenance issues arise
